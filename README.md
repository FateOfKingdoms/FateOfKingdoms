Fate Of Kingdoms is an upcoming MMORPG Server for Minecraft.

Fate Of Kingdoms is a server that focuses on a complete Decision-based RPG experience in a massively multiplayer open world.

Fate Of Kingdoms story is about two kingdoms that have been battling for many centuries, 
until one day, when a brave adventure enters the lands and helps decide the kingdoms' fate. 
While playing throughout the story and the open world, the player makes many decisions that 
help to form the story, on which kingdom the adventure will help, or if the player wants to 
go a separate way to form their allegiant and take over the other kingdoms. While exploring 
the open world, the player will experience many different cultures, quests, adventures, and 
other players that also have a part in the story. As a player, you can collect many different 
kinds of equipment, artifact, pets, cosmetics, and more.

As of now, Fate Of Kingdoms is just an idea (I, a solo developer), will work on it in my free time. 
I do not have much planned for Fate Of Kingdoms, but I will work on it as often as possible and, of 
course, update you as much as possible!
